Ozaki Anime

<p align="center">
 Watch anime on your desktop without any ads. An All-In-One app. It is totally free. Although it was intended primarily for anime, I decided to include more in the future. Simply said, I no longer want websites to open new tabs and direct me to sexual and e-commerce websites. You've been there, I believe. Adblock extensions blocker is nowadways installed. In order to watch and read, I must turn off my adblocker. This project is personal. At your own risk, use it. You're lucky if you found this app.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later. (Latest Patch or Update)
